### Problem statement
The following assignment required the creation of two Jupyter Notebooks one called ```pyplot.ipynb``` and the other ```cao.ipynb```.

#### pyplot 
The project required a clear and concise overview of the matplotlib.pyplot and an in-depth explanation of three interesting plots from matplotlib.pyplot.

The notebook covers:
* Histograms
* Scatterplots
* Boxplots

The main dataset used is Fisher's Iris data set

The notebook can be viewed here:

#### CAO data

The project required a clear and concise overview of how to load CAO points information from the CAO website into a pandas data frame. A detailed comparison of CAO points in 2019, 2020, and 2021 using the functionality in pandas.

This project focused on data from 2019, 2020 and 2021 for level 8 courses.
